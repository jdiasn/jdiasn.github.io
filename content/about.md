Hi, I am  Jos√©, a physicist. Since my firsts years in physics undergrad, I became interested in learning about the physics that rules the atmospheric processes. While I was still an undergrad student, I used the signal transmitted by satellites to study changes in the density of ions in the outermost layer of the atmosphere. Since then, I have been using remote sensing observations to study the various atmospheric processes.  

I often wondered about the formation of snowflakes up there in the clouds. I was curious to learn about their growth and the factors that control their shape. So, during my PhD, I combined data from 3 different radars (X-, Ka-, and W-Band) to study the formation of snowflakes. 

Currently, as a postdoctoral researcher, I am studying the interaction of wind and clouds. Does the wind change clouds? Do clouds change the wind? To answer those questions,  I am using lidar and radar to measure the wind from near the surface to the cloud top.
