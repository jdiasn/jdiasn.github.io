In 2007 I bought my first camera (an Olympus E-volt 500). It was as very good investment.
After that moment, I started to be in contact with the amazing world of photography and 
learn about it. 
Unfortunately, that camera broke. Currently, I'm using a Nikon D-5100 - which is as good as 
my first camera.  

Since I begun this new hobby I have been taking photos of different things. I believe that my 
best picture is that one below. 

I have others beautiful pictures; they are hosted in my account at [500px](https://500px.com/jdiasn).
