Hi, I'm physicist. Since my firsts years in physics undergrad I became interested at environmental
physical processes. Actually I'm working to evaluate Aerosol Optical Thickness retrieved by VIIRS 
sensor.

I realized that actually doing physics is much more enjoyable than just learning it. Maybe 
'doing it' is the right way of learning. (Gerd Binnig - Nobel Prize 1989)
