Hi, I'm physicist. Since my firsts years in physics undergrad I became interested in environmental
physical processes. I'm currently working to evaluate Aerosol Optical Thickness retrieved by
the VIIRS sensor.

I realized that actually doing physics is much more enjoyable than just learning it. Maybe 
'doing it' is the right way of learning. (Gerd Binnig - Nobel Prize 1989)

**In Preparation**

Evaluation of Aerosol Optical Depth retrieved by VIIRS during pre-burning season and 
burning season over South America. *in prep*.

We describe the agreement performance between aerosol data retrieved by VIIRS (satellite sensor) 
and two others measurement platforms ; AERONET photometer (ground sensor) and MODIS 
(satellite sensor).
