Hi, I'm a physicist. Since my firsts years in physics undergrad, I became interested 
in environmental physical processes. I'm currently working with multi-frequency radar 
observations of snow clouds to understand the growth of snowflakes better. 

"I realized that actually doing physics is much more enjoyable than just learning it. Maybe 
'doing it' is the right way of learning." (Gerd Binnig - Nobel Prize 1989)

**In Preparation**

Evaluation of Aerosol Optical Depth retrieved by VIIRS during pre-burning season and 
burning season over South America. *in prep*.

We describe the agreement performance between aerosol data retrieved by VIIRS (satellite sensor) 
and two others measurement platforms ; AERONET photometer (ground sensor) and MODIS 
(satellite sensor).
