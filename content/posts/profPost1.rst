On Oct. 28, 2011 the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership spacecraft was launched. It is 
a result of mutual cooperation between NASA and NOAA. This spacecraft is composed by five sensors
to monitor Earth System. One of them is Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (`VIIRS`_). One 
possible utility is to monitor Aerosol Optical Thickness.  

In Brazil, the National Institute For Space Research is data receiver of environmental satellite
data. In particular, my job is to evaluate performance of Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) on 
the Brazil. The hart of procedure is to compare AOT retrieved by VIIRS with AOT measured in 
AERONET sites and with AOT retrieved by `MODIS`_ sensor.

The figure above shows spatial difference for VIIRS and MODIS AOT data on June, 2014. 
The result collection is hosted in `AOT Results`_.
