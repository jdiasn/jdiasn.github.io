At 2013, I had opportunity to participate of scientific team from 
[PIRATA](http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pirata/)
project, on board of [OCEAN STALWART](http://www.marinetraffic.com/pt/ais/details/ships/shipid:738424/mmsi:576785000/imo:8835516/vessel:OCEAN_STALWART) 
Research/Survey Vessel. Our main activity was to maintain nine oceanic buoys from that project. 
During displacement between each buoy, we measured atmospheric and oceanic variables. 
The equipment used in measurements was atmospheric balloon sounding, expendable  current 
profiler (XCP), and UnderwayCTD. I performed some of this measurements using these sensors.

The picture above shows the moment in which I'm disassembling the buoy, and the
